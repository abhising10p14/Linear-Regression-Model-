This projetc is for the learnng purpose. It includes  building Liner Regression Models and manipulating data using libraries:
1. graphlab -> owned by Turi , you can get it from https://turi.com/download/academic.html 
	**** It is not free for comercial purpose but you can get licence for using it for academic purpose for free 
	you can also use Scikit, numpy which are free and don't require any license but they are not useful when it comes to handle very large data which can't be stored into your main memory. So I will sugets you to go for graphlab. Also it is easy to use and have simple syntax

2. SFrames

3. Matplotlib

4. PTL :  Python Template Language ->  make it easier to generate HTML pages (or other forms of text)  , Don't worry I am not going to do some 										  advance level of web development here but just using image part og PLT to display images

Before proceeding further I am assuming that you already know about Machine Learning if not everything then must be familliar with Linear regression models, RMSE , RSS (Root square error),Overfitting. 

What this project is all about ?
It uses a dataset of features of houses in US and then uses some of the features from it to build some models and then we compare the accuracy of hese models using graphs and some values.
It is not aimed to provide the best model but to help you learn basics of how we apply the knowledge of linear regression into practical

I have peovided the output  snapshots and graph snapshots along with the source code 
if any problem or any suggestion you would want to give me, mail me at abhisingh10p14@gmail.com
